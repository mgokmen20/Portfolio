                <p>Hi. This blog post is very special to me. I have written blog posts before, but it has been a long
                    time. I am designing this website to participate in the Powercoders bootcamp program. That's why I
                    am very excited. Since the day I came to Switzerland, I have been dreaming of being able to join
                    this program. I don't know, maybe I am very close. 
                    <br> Instead of talking about the past, I want to tell
                    you what I have been doing today. I have had the opportunity to experience many fields and
                    programming languages. Finally, I decided to continue my path as a web developer. For this, I
                    benefited from various platforms. <br>The courses prepared by Dr. Angela Yu on the Udemy platform were
                    very useful for me. I am still taking these courses. I try to reinforce what I have learned by doing
                    a lot of examples. That's why I am progressing slowly. On the one hand, my German course continues.
                    Of course, I continue to work to improve my English. That's why I can't allocate much time. But I
                    think I have made significant progress in HTML and CSS. I don't feel ready for real projects yet.
                    The reason is that I have never worked on a real project before. For this, I need a mentor's support
                    or friends to develop projects together.</p><br>
                <p>I have also prepared a few example websites with Bootstrap. But I need to improve more. After that, I
                    will move on to the Javascript topic. I want to progress with React, Node JS, and database
                    structures. I had done some work with Python for the backend before. In addition to that, I want to
                    work on Node JS and Java. Throughout this journey, you can follow me to give me ideas or benefit
                    from the experiences I will gain. Hope to see you again soon.</p>
